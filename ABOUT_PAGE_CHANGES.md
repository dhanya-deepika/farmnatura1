## Responsive Breakpoints:

The design now works seamlessly across all screen sizes:

- **Mobile (< 640px)**: Single column layout, optimized font sizes
- **Small (640px - 768px)**: Slightly larger fonts, better spacing
- **Medium (768px - 1024px)**: Two-column layouts start appearing
- **Large (1024px - 1280px)**: Full two-column layouts, larger images
- **XL (1280px+)**: Maximum design sizes, optimal spacing

## Technical Improvements:

1. **Container System**: Used consistent container with responsive padding
2. **Image Optimization**: All images use Next.js Image component with `fill` prop
3. **Typography**: Consistent font families (Jost for headings, Sofia Pro/Josefin Sans for body)
4. **Color Scheme**: 
   - Primary text: #404040
   - Secondary text: #282828, #4a4a4a, #727272
   - Background: #FFFDF2
   - Accent: Green (#358b6c)
5. **Spacing**: Consistent use of Tailwind spacing utilities
6. **Animations**: Maintained GSAP animations for smooth transitions

## Testing:

The application has been tested and is running successfully on:

## Files Modified:

- `components/About.tsx` - Complete redesign with responsive layout

## Browser Compatibility:

The design uses modern CSS features supported by all major browsers:
- Flexbox for layouts
- CSS Grid (minimal usage)
- Responsive images
- Smooth transitions

## Performance Optimizations:

1. Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
2. Lazy loading for images
3. Efficient GSAP animations
4. Minimal re-renders with proper React hooks

## Next Steps:

1. Test on actual devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Verify all images are loading correctly
3. Check accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
4. Optimize for SEO (meta tags, alt texts)
5. Consider adding loading states for images
